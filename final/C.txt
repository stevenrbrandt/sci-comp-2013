1. You and a group of other researchers have produced a scientific code (using C and MPI) and have run a handful of test cases on Ranger to verify that it functions correctly. Should you release it? If not, what should you do?
2. You work with a code that simulates hurricanes. In order to be useful the code has to produce a result within six hours. Currently, it takes seven. Upon inspecting the code, you discover it is a reasonably well written MPI parallel code. What might you do to improve the performance?
3. What are advantages of using an IDE for programming, and why is there sometimes a high resistance especially among experienced programmers?
4. Name at least three debugging utilities and describe how they work.
5. What sorts of errors can you identify using valgrind?
6. Name at least two utilities you can use for profiling?
