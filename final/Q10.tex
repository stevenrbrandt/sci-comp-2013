\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Module A}: From a scientific viewpoint: name one good and one bad reason to apply obfuscation.
\item \textbf{Module B}: Explain the threaded execution model. What is a thread? What are the pitfalls? How do you mitigate those?
\item \textbf{Module C}: Name at least two utilities you can use for profiling?
\item \textbf{Module D}: Describe the roles of the flesh and the thorns in Cactus.
\item \textbf{Module E}: Estimate to within an order of magnitude the number of jobs that are executed in theWorldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) per day. Estimate to within an order of magnitude the number of bytes of data generated (overall) by the WLCG. Take the cost of LHC Experiment to be \$1B a year. Therefore what is the cost of generating a byte of data from the LHC experiment?
