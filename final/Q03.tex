\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Module A}: From a scientific viewpoint: name one good and one bad reason to apply obfuscation.
\item \textbf{Module B}: Explain weak scaling and strong scaling, what's their relation to the modalities of parallel computing
\item \textbf{Module C}: You work with a code that simulates hurricanes. In order to be useful the code has to produce a result within six hours. Currently, it takes seven. Upon inspecting the code, you discover it is a reasonably well written MPI parallel code. What might you do to improve the performance?
\item \textbf{Module D}: Describe the role of the driver thorn in Cactus.
\item \textbf{Module E}: Of the applications discussed what are the most common reasons for "distributing"? How they were distributed? Name some tools
