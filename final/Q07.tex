\textbf{Name:}\\*[3em]
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Module A}: Provide two reasons why the same text file can look different when viewed on different systems or within different tools.
\item \textbf{Module B}: Explain weak scaling and strong scaling, what's their relation to the modalities of parallel computing
\item \textbf{Module C}: What are advantages of using an IDE for programming, and why is there sometimes a high resistance especially among experienced programmers?
\item \textbf{Module D}: Explain in basic terms what a scientific simulation is and what it's main ingredients are.
\item \textbf{Module E}: Estimate to within an order of magnitude the number of jobs that are executed in theWorldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) per day. Estimate to within an order of magnitude the number of bytes of data generated (overall) by the WLCG. Take the cost of LHC Experiment to be \$1B a year. Therefore what is the cost of generating a byte of data from the LHC experiment?
